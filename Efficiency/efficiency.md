# Hamming Code Efficiency
Efficiency here is defined as the amount parity bits needed relative to message length needed for an error detector to function properly.

Hamming code efficiency is dependent on the length of the message it is parsing. For a message below 52 bits, efficiency is below 80%, meaning other error detectors would work better.
However, beyond that the hamming code becomes more and more efficient. This is calculated in the graph that follows, generated by the python code in this directory.
